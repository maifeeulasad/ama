Although I don't get a lot of questions by email, still this way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
However, I will think twice before answering. :joy:

### Guidelines

 - :mag: Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
 - :memo: Use a succinct title and description.
 - :bug: Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
 - :signal_strength: Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
 - :blush: Be nice, civil and polite.
 - :heart_eyes: If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback will
   probably come faster.
